## Introduction
`Data Structures and Algorithms in Python` provides an introduction to data structures and algorithms, including their
design, analysis, and implementation. This book is designed for use in a beginninglevel
data structures course, or in an intermediate-level introduction to algorithms
course.

Desired outcomes for readers of the book include that:
- They have knowledge of the most common abstractions for data collections
(e.g., stacks, queues, lists, trees, maps).
- They understand algorithmic strategies for producing efficient realizations of
common data structures.
- They can analyze algorithmic performance, both theoretically and experimentally,
and recognize common trade-offs between competing strategies.
- They can wisely use existing data structures and algorithms found in modern
programming language libraries.
- They have experience working with concrete implementations for most foundational
data structures and algorithms.
- They can apply data structures and algorithms to solve complex problems.
